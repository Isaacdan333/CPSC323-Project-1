#Lexical Analyzer  

## Introduction
  CPSC 323 - Project 1  
  Group members: Hao Ly, Darren Cruz, Isaac Perez  
  Program: Lexical Analyzer  
  Input file: input_scode.txt  
  Output file: output.txt  
  Language: C++  

## Description
  The Lexical Analyzer is a C++ program designed to break source code into tokens and lexemes. This tool helps in the initial phase of a compiler where it scans the source code and identifies the individual elements, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals. It then generates an output file that contains these tokens and their corresponding lexemes  

## Usage
**Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine. You can use the following command  
  `https://github.com/Isaacdan333/CPSC323-Project-1.git`

**Compile the Program**: Navigate to the project directory and compile the C++ program. You can use a C++ compiler like g++  
  `g++ LexicalAnalyzer.cpp -o LexicalAnalyzer`

**Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program with the provided input file `input_scode.txt` and specify the output file `output.txt`. You can do this by running the following command:
  `./LexicalAnalyzer input_scode.txt output.txt`  

**View the Output**: Once the program finishes running, you can open the `output.txt` file to see the tokens and their corresponding lexemes extracted from the source code.
